My thesis aims at providing tools to improve our understanding of ecological communities.
To this end, I tackled diverse research questions and methodologies. 

In a first axis, I use multivariate methods to analyze bird-plants frugivory networks. 
These methods provide insights into trait matching and niche-based processes. 
Case studies suggest that there is a signal of trait matching, but that it is 
weak in frugivory networks.

In a second axis, I use point processes of the multivariate Hawkes process family
to infer interspecific interactions from camera trap data. I test these methods using
simulations, and a case study on African mammals. Simulations suggest that under
certain conditions, multivariate Hawkes processes can be used to analyze camera trap data.
The case study highlights expected patterns of attraction-avoidance between lion,
impala, kudu, wildebeest and zebra.

In a third axis, I present two software tools designed during my thesis to analyze
camera trap data ({[camtrapviz](/tools/camtrapviz)} and 
{[standardizeSnapshot](/tools/standardizeSnapshot)}).

In the discussion of the manuscript, I also share some thoughts on open science 
and reproducibility, the epistemology of ecology and my experience of research
during my PhD.
