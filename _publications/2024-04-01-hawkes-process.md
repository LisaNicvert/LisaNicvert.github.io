This article models species occurrences at camera traps as a multivariate 
Hawkes process (MHP). The MHP allows to derive interaction functions between species
pairs, where the intensity of interaction is a function of the time elapsed since the
first species' occurrence. In our framework, these interactions can be positive or
negative, are asymmetrical and non-parametric.

In this article, we present a proof-of-concept of the MHP on simulated and real data.
We notably find interesting patterns of attraction-avoidance between five species
of African mammals: zebras and impalas seem to avoid lions, while zebra and impala
attract all other herbivores, and wildebeest attracts zebra.

This is my very first peer-reviewed article, published during my PhD. It's the
result of two years of hard work, multiple analyses and extensive discussions with all co-authors.
I think the MHP is relevant to think about interactions inferred from camera 
trap data. It may not be widely applicable yet, because of methodological limitations 
and (relative) data scarcity, but I hope these limitations can be overcome in the near future.

If you're interested in camera trap data and/or interspecific interactions, give it a read!
