This preprint proposes to use correspondence analysis and reciprocal scaling to 
analyze interaction networks. These unconstrained ordination methods allow to 
order species along a latent gradient, which can be interpreted as their latent traits
involved in their interactions. This provides a method to investigate trait matching
between species, _even when traits are not measured!_
