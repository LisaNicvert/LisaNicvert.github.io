I presented this poster at the International Statistical Ecology Conference (ISEC) 2022, in Cape Town, while visiting my PhD co-supervisor's lab in South Africa. The poster can be seen [here](/files/poster_ISEC.pdf). [An article](/publication/2024-04-01-hawkes process) based in the results presented in this poster was published in 2024.
