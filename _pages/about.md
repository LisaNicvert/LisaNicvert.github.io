I am an early-career ecologist, and work on questions related to community ecology, interspecific interactions and opportunistic data analysis. My research interests lie at the interface between the study of biodiversity and statistical developments and analyzes.

I am originally trained in bioinformatics and modelling. I specialized in ecology because I was (and still am) amazed by the complexity of the natural world, and I am yearning to understand the processes that structure ecosystems. Moreover, I am convinced that quantitative ecological studies are needed to mitigate the current biodiversity crisis.

Since November 2024, I work as a postdocoral fellow at FRB-Cesab. Together with the consortium of the DRAGON project, I investigate the response of European dragonflies to anthropogenic pressures through occupancy models.

During my PhD (defended in 2024), I developed statistical methods and software tools to analyze ecological networks and community data. In a first axis, I extended multivariate methods to study trait matching in ecological networks. Secondly, I tested a new point process model to infer interspecific interactions from camera trap data. Finally, I developed software tools to analyze camera trap data.
