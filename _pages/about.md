## Welcome!

I am an ecologist trained in statistics and modelling. My research interests 
are broad, and they include interspecific interactions, niche modelling or 
camera trap data analysis. 
I am also deeply interested in statistical developments and in reproducible 
tools for for ecological data analysis.

I specialized in statistical ecology both because I have a fundamental interest in understanding the processes structuring ecosystems, and 
because I am convinced that quantitative ecological studies are needed to mitigate the current biodiversity crisis.

Since November 2024, I work as a postdocoral fellow at FRB-Cesab. Together with the consortium of the [DRAGON project](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/dragon/), I investigate the response of European dragonflies to anthropogenic pressures through occupancy models.

During my PhD (defended in 2024), I developed statistical methods and software tools to analyze ecological networks and community data. In a first axis, I extended multivariate methods to study trait matching in ecological networks. Secondly, I tested a new point process model to infer interspecific interactions from camera trap data. Finally, I developed software tools to analyze camera trap data.
